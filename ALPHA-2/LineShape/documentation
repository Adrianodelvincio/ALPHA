- scanMvaData

this folder contains all the datasets generated for each MVA point. The hyperfine splitting is uniformly generated around the cpt value with interval (-30, + 10) kHz.

- scanMvaData2

this folder contains all the datasets generated for each MVA point. The hyperfine splitting is uniformly generated around the cpt value with interval (-15, + 15) kHz.


- point 1 


Data corresponding to MVA working point mu = 0.046, efficiency = 0.775

- point 2

Data corresponding to MVA working point mu = 0.01, efficiency = 0.638

- point 3

Data corresponding to MVA working point mu = 0.23, efficiency = 0.86

- Test_1

Test 1 of the cost function.

Interval of generation:  (-20,20)

- Test_2

Test 2 of the cost function

interval of generation [-40,0] (pay attention, binbeforeonset = 4)

- Test_3

Test 3 of the cost function

interval of generation [-40, 40] (pay attention, binbeforeonset = 4)

- Test_4 

Test 4 of the cost function

interval of generation [-40, 20] (pay attention, binbeforeonset = 4)

FROM HERE, ALL THE DATASET HAVE BDRIFT

- Passcut

Passcut dataset, The hyperfine splitting is uniformly generated around the cpt value with interval (-30, + 10) kHz.


- scanMvaData3

this folder contains all the datasets generated for each MVA point. The hyperfine splitting is uniformly generated around the cpt value with interval (-30, + 10) kHz.
The Bdrift effects are simulated, also the start of the sweep is considered with operator error.

-ScanMvaData4

Same ad scanMvaData3 but ALL the Bdrift effects are simulated.
