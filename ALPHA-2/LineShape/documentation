- scanMvaData

this folder contains all the datasets generated for each MVA point. The hyperfine splitting is uniformly generated around the cpt value with interval (-30, + 10) kHz.

- scanMvaData2

this folder contains all the datasets generated for each MVA point. The hyperfine splitting is uniformly generated around the cpt value with interval (-15, + 15) kHz.
